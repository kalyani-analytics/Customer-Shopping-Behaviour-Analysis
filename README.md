# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow** using Python, SQL, and Power BI.  
The goal of the project is to load and analyze a dataset, extract meaningful insights through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, validate findings using **SQL queries on PostgreSQL**, and present results through an **interactive Power BI dashboard**, a **written report**, and a **presentation (PPT)**.

This project showcases practical skills required for a **Data Analyst role**, including data cleaning, querying, visualization, and storytelling.

## ⚙️ Project Steps
1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas
   - Performed initial inspection (shape, columns, data types)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed distributions, trends, and outliers
   - Identified patterns and relationships between variables
   - Visualized insights using charts and plots

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed duplicates
   - Standardized formats and corrected data types

4. **SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)**
   - Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL
   - Wrote SQL queries to:
     - Aggregate data
     - Filter and segment records
     - Validate Python-based insights

5. **Dashboard Development**
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
   - Included KPIs, charts, filters, and slicers for analysis

6. **Reporting & Presentation**
   - Created a structured analysis report
   - Designed a professional PPT using Gamma to communicate insights clearly

## 📊 Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard highlights:
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Trends and patterns
- Category-wise and time-based analysis
- Interactive filters for deeper exploration

📌 *Dashboard file available in the `/powerbi` folder.*

---

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Identified key trends and patterns in the data
- Highlighted areas of improvement and opportunities
- Converted raw data into actionable insights through visuals and queries

*(Add 2–3 bullet points with actual insights once finalized)*
